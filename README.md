# NSSFinalProject
Final Capstone for Nashville Software School

# Why I am Building this:
I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a double major in Literature and  Psychology with the long-term goal of
teaching Literature and Creative Writing. Even though I ended up going another direction vocationally, my love
for reading and writing remained. I always found myself searching for new books and recommendations yet failing to save these
suggestions in an efficent manner. With this site, those problems will fade. With 'Project Name' you will
 be able to search, add, and save books to your 'BookShelf' as well as see your fellow Book nerd's reading lists. You will also be able to send recommendations to your friends with a note as to why you think this book is a good reccommendation for your friend. You will also be able to tag books you have read with fan fiction essays tied to books that inspire you. These essays can be shared and viewed by friends and judged with thumbs up and thumbs down due to there popularity or unpopularity.


# Stretch Goals: 

Create a Quiz that will ask the user a set of questions. With the user's answers and the quiz submitted, a list of suggested books to read will display. The user can then add these books to their bookshelf or discard. 

# What I want to Accomplish:

- More practice working with APIs
- More hands on experience working with the MVC Framework
- Make a site that, I, myself would use
- Work on user experience more - Have a User First Mindset as I build this site
